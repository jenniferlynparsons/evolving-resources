# JP's curriculum 2018

This is my second go around at a curriculum of this type. The last was more informal and patchwork. This one has specific intentions behind it for things I'm looking to learn and brush up on.

Where possible I've used free materials both for economy and to make this something others can use as inspiration. I've found the Frontend Masters courses to be worth the subscription when I'm using them (and suspend the subscription when I'm not). I've marked items that are paid with a * and will be updating with free materials for future reference as I find them.
