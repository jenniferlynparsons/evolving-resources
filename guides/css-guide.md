# A guide to CSS

CSS is a broad topic as the styling language is more complex than it appears at the surface. The more modern additions of grid, flexbox, and various animation tools (not to mention preprocessors!) has made the topic difficult to sum up in a guide such as this. That said, I have selected the courses, articles, and other resources that I've found most helpful or return to on a regular basis.
